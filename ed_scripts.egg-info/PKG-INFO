Description: # ed_scripts
        This contains basic scripts that are used within my educational notebooks.  The basic capabilities are summarized below:
        
        ## Input Array Rows
        The two main funcations are :
        
        *  in_array.array_floats - This takes a string (i.e. from param form) and checks that the values can be converted to floats.  If not, it returns a None for the data; otherwise, an array of floats.  See the code for the details.
        
        *  in_array.array_ints - This takes a string (i.e. from param form) and checks that the values can be converted to int.  If not, it returns a None for the data; otherwise, an array of ints.  See the code for the details.
